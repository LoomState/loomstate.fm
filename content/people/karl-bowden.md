Karl works as a Senior Developer at [Mezzanine](http://mezzanine.co) and is one half of the duo behind Loom State Productions.

He's a self-taught brute force polyglot, with a deep knowledge of human interaction and codebases.

A sometimes stubborn, but terribly kind father of two, Karl knows how to overuse a good dad joke and doesn't mind a quick four hour board game.
